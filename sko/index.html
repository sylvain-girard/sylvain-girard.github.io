		    I definitely learned a lot through the making of this project, and I think it is surely going to help me in future projects. I had always been quite interested in font design, though the process looked quite daunting and I never really delved far into it. I was quite pleasantly surprised how doable it is, especially with Fontforge being an open source program. Having only recently been exposed to the world of variable fonts, I was really hoping to be able to create one myself, though I had pretty much zero idea of the process involved. When I started to design my font I was not sure if I would be able to find the time to make it variable, but I still designed every letter with the intention of making it variable at some point, so hopefully the process would not be too painstaking later on.<br>
		<br>
		Overall I am very happy with the typeface that I made, being that I was able to combine several interests of mine into one font, and especially as I was able to make it variable with enough time left to experiment with it a bit for the sampler. While I am also pleased with the sampler I made, I think if I had more time to explore the possibilities/restrictions of variable fonts in p5js I would create something completely different. In saying that, I’m glad I could create a sampler just using the coding knowledge I had gained from the last semester and practicing in between, as a sort of test for what I can do and can’t do (yet). <br>
		<br>
		While creating the variable font, I was coming up with so many more potential ideas for variable fonts, so I’m going to try to make the most of the rest of my free trial of Glyphs and make another of my ideas. I think variable fonts are going to be a large part of type design in the future so it’s great to create something in this early stage of the field.
